Our
work contributes to building a model to predict a health score for an
individual, for this study we used health data to determine the like hood if
someone can have diabetes in near future or not.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Health Scoring has the similar idea, aiming to give clients a precise concept of their health condition and lead them to have a healthier lifestyle. The score for clients’ health condition is based on a series of factors such as clients’ physical activity, diet, heart rate, skin temperature and blood pressure. With advent of the continuous progress in technology, more and more wearable devices can test and supervise people’s health condition. All data will be collected and presented through smart mobile devices, such as widespread smart phone. A new wave of wearable sensors allows frequent and continuous measurements measurement of body functions. A new research from Stanford, published on Jan 12th, 2017, showed that fitness monitors and other wearable biosensors can tell when an individual’s heart rate, skin temperature and other measures are abnormal, suggesting possible illness. With the more powerful wearable devices and ever-expanding market, wearable sensors are likely to play an important role in managing health. 

In this study, we chose Type II diabetes as an example to build a health score model, since diabetes is the most common and serious chronic disease in the United States. There are nearly 26 million Americans with diabetes, while Type II diabetes is the most prevalent type, estimated to account for 90-95% of the patients with diabetes. Type II diabetes is known to be highly associated with genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors. Compared with former study, we combined medical data and sensor data in our factor tree, using machine learning algorithms to build scoring models. We used four models, logistic regression, K-nearest neighbors algorithm, random forest and gradient boosting. Furthermore, the aim of this study is to design a more accurate classifier for diabetes. For this reason, we introduced a two layers ensemble algorithm.

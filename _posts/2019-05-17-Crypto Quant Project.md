Big Wave Turns Over 0.1:<br>
     Optimization goal: retracement of revenue balance
     Disadvantages: floating profit back. The floating profit that is chasing up is likely to be spit out due to a sudden drop. It is very strong in the big trend and not as good as it is in the shock city.
          It is impossible to respond in time and the phenomenon of income reversal occurs. This kind of digital currency has soared and plunged more, so when using the Tangqi'an channel and calculating the ATR, the return time should be appropriately shortened.<br>

#0.0 In April, I got the start of the market, but the manual operation of one month was too tiring, and it was difficult to completely avoid negative emotions. Vnpy also updated version 2.0, so I finally decided to toss a quantitative platform.<br>

Beginning

2018.01.08

Four years after the university, the code ability in the same age financial dog has been able to traverse, and also touched the quant platforms like joinquant candle ricequant . At this time, the market was active again, so I began to want to do crypto currency quantification, using the botvs (fmz) quantitative platform to develop cross-currency arbitrage robots, but the efficiency is not high, and development also delays making money. . If you have no time, you will not continue.


2013.12.01

Freshman touched crypto, looked at the candle line and found that the red, green and green can be a bit predictive (in fact, MACD), so I plan to use a computer to simulate the transaction, so I used the button wizard to develop (because there is image recognition...), the basis for judgment is only macdkdjrsi, risk management is only guaranteed. The source code changed to another computer and deleted. It’s a pity. After all, this broken thing finally has 300 lines (who know what I wrote).

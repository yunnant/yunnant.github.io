Our work contributes to building a model to predict a health score for an
individual, for this study we used health data to determine the like hood if
someone can have diabetes in near future or not.                                                                                                                                                         

Health Scoring is aiming to give clients a precise concept of their health condition and lead them to have a healthier lifestyle. The score for clients’ health condition is based on a series of factors such as clients’ physical activity, diet, heart rate, skin temperature and blood pressure. With advent of the continuous progress in technology, more and more wearable devices can test and supervise people’s health condition. All data will be collected and presented through smart mobile devices, such as widespread smart phone. A new wave of wearable sensors allows frequent and continuous measurements measurement of body functions.

In this study, we chose Type II diabetes as an example to build a health score model. Type II diabetes is known to be highly associated with genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors. Compared with former study, we combined medical data and sensor data in our factor tree, using machine learning algorithms to build scoring models. We used four models, logistic regression, K-nearest neighbors algorithm, random forest and gradient boosting. Furthermore, the aim of this study is to design a more accurate classifier for diabetes. For this reason, we introduced a two layers ensemble algorithm.

Considering the confidentiality, I can not show the details to you.

Here is the result for our training.

And this is our interface for users.

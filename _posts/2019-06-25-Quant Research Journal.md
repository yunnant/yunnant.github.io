- 20200524: Graded fund transactions

Calculation: **initial leverage ratio** = (type A share matching number + type B share matching number) / type B share matching number. The initial leverage ratio of the equity-type grading fund cannot exceed 2 times, and the initial leverage ratio of the bond-type grading fund cannot exceed 10/3 times. The **transaction price of the** mother share = (A share price + B share price) / 2

Conversion: The first type is called regular conversion. Refers to the payment of the agreed interest of Class A shares at the end of an interest calculation cycle, similar to fund dividends. The second kind is called up-folding mechanism. One characteristic of graded funds is the leverage of fund B shares, which is also a point preferred by investors. But as the net value of the parent fund grows, the net value leverage of the B share will become smaller and smaller. In order to avoid excessively low B-share leverage, the hierarchical fund has set up a discount mechanism. It means that when the profit of the parent fund rises to a certain level, the profit will be converted and the return of the B share will be paid. The third type is called the down-fold mechanism. When the investment market is not good, if the B share loses to a certain extent, the principal and interest of the A share will be threatened, so a liquidation mechanism is also set up, which is also called a discount mechanism. Once the discount mechanism is triggered, the B share will be returned to the A share for most of the principal, ensuring that the A share will not suffer losses to the greatest extent.

Reason for premium: The overall discount premium refers to the situation where the virtual "transaction price" of the parent share deviates significantly from its unit net worth. When the "transaction price" of the parent share is significantly higher than its unit net value, that is, an overall premium has occurred, the arbitrageur can purchase two parent shares, and then paired into a pair of child shares, and then sold, earning the price difference, this is Premium arbitrage; when the "transaction price" of the parent share is significantly lower than its unit net value, the arbitrageur can buy a pair of child shares, convert the pair into two parent shares, and then redeem it to earn the spread. This is a discount arbitrage. As an example of premium arbitrage, if investors are optimistic about an industry, as long as the market discount rate is stable, the price of the A share will remain stable, so the overall A and B shares have a premium. The premium will encourage arbitrageurs to enter. What the arbitrageurs do is that the aforementioned timing investors are too lazy to do things, that is, purchase the parent share, split the pairing into A and B shares, and then sell the A share to insurance institutions, sell B Shares are sold to timing investors.

Risk: Spread risk of t+2, 3, the sudden risk and liquidity risk of delisting of the current graded funds.

- 20200517: Convertible bond transaction

Calculation: **Number of convertible shares** : 100/converted stock price, **value of** convertible **stock** = face value of convertible bond/converted stock price*positive stock price **.** , Premium rate: **Conversion premium rate (premium rate)** = (convertible bond price-conversion value) / conversion value * 100%, the higher the conversion premium rate, the harder it is for the convertible bond to keep up with the rise in the stock, right The more lagging the response of the stocks rise. From this perspective, the lower the convertible bond premium rate, the better **. Pure debt premium rate (option value)** = (convertible bond price-pure debt value) / pure debt value * 100%

Opportunity: **Use convertible bonds to chase up and stop stocks; the arbitrage with a negative premium rate during the conversion period, when the** discount is above **2%** (2% is the empirical value), the conversion needs T+1, and the securities can be sold to hedge the stock **; Priority allotment arbitrage** : Listed companies issue convertible bonds through the review of the China Securities Regulatory Commission. Listed companies will try their best to raise the stock price in various ways to increase the conversion price; **strong redemption countdown arbitrage** : because the forced redemption is about to occur , the holders of convertible bonds At this time, people will be converted into stocks to sell, which will suppress the stock price, but due to the strength of the stock itself, it will make the stock price rise. **New** ; **option calculation (reportedly not easy to use)**

Rule: Repurchase **clause** : If the closing price of a listed company lasts for 30 trading days, it is lower than 70% of the conversion price. At this time, we have the right to sell back the convertible bonds to the company at the price of 100 yuan + interest ; In order to avoid the resale, the company will raise the stock price and lower the conversion stock price. **Decrease the conversion stock price** . When the **stock price** of a convertible bond corresponds to 20 consecutive trading days, and the closing price of more than 10 trading days is lower than 85% of the conversion stock price, the board of directors can propose to reduce the conversion stock price; **Compulsory redemption** : During the convertible bond conversion period of this issuance, the closing price of A-share stocks for at least 15 trading days out of 30 consecutive trading days is not less than 130% of the current conversion price (including 130 %), the company has the right to redeem all or part of the unconvertible convertible bonds at the price of the bond face value plus current interest accrued.

Others: pay attention to cash flow, pay attention to the company, bondholders, and major shareholders of the three-party game; debt-to-equity swaps will dilute shareholder equity and improve cash flow, whether or not to consider the size and shareholding structure

Risks: Taijing convertible bonds are suddenly redeemed in advance, and major shareholders reduce risk-free arbitrage

Introduction to quantitative investment: LPPL log-period shock model: Based on the mutual imitation between traders, these local interactions can form positive feedback, which leads to the generation of bubbles and anti-bubble; the evolution of anti-bubble prices in financial markets exhibits logarithmic periodicity Oscillation, the oscillation period is continuously extended. The financial bubble is just the opposite, showing that the oscillation cycle is shortened. The characteristics of the seismic model are: first, the log periodic oscillation, the closer to the critical time at the linear scale, the faster the oscillation frequency, but at the log scale, the oscillation frequency is constant; the second is the power law growth, also known as super exponential growth , That is, the growth rate of the price is not a constant, but a monotonous increase; the calendar effect: January effect (loss in December), North American self-driving to buy May oil in April, fell on Friday & rose on Monday; micro data informed trading probability model, To measure the degree of information asymmetry of participants. ; Event-driven: fixed increase to lift the ban, surplus drift, block trading. ; Clock factor

Event-driven strategy for tax avoidance bulk transactions: Income tax is payable when restricted shares are lifted. Restricted shares become non-restricted shares, and even if they rise to 1,000 yuan in the future, they will not have to pay taxes again. This is the origin of so-called tax avoidance. The low discount may be changing hands. However, I personally think that this kind of strategic thinking is too absolute and needs to consider more things.

Over-the-counter derivatives: OTC swaps can use margin as leverage, which is a higher transaction bar than financing and margin trading. The holdings are outside of the two financing targets, and the contract duration and income structure are designed to be flexible and thickened in combination with bulk transactions. Relevant income; use the swap to realize the buy-out repurchase financing function; through the swap agreement to realize the disguised “bond-bonding” transaction

Linked rotation: single industry: calculation of the industry's excess return calculation confidence (conditional probability) support, multi-industry (conditional) rotation, intraday pull-up strong strategy; this research report backtesting linkage is more effective than rotation.

Text mining: Individuals have observed that market sentiment may be more stable than the market, with strong trends and low volatility; unpopular stocks have excess returns; *thematic investment: new topics see posts related stocks are quickly positioned, old topics see text related stocks to determine correlations selected. Periodic heat events (World Cup)*

**"Quantitative Hedge Lab-Alpha-Strategy Factor Selection and Evaluation"** profitability, valuation, cash flow, growth, asset allocation, price momentum and technical factors; the main principles of screening factors are: a. accuracy of data And authenticity; b. data integrity; c. stability of data sources. ; There are two main methods for studying the relationship between stock excess returns and factor parameters. The first is to group the stocks according to the size of the factor parameters, calculate the average excess return of each group, and perform the factor win rate and t test in turn. The second type is to calculate the correlation coefficient and information ratio of the excess return rate and factor parameter size on the cross section of all stocks at each time point. ; The general method of eliminating redundant factors is as follows: a. We take out the sequence of each effective factor at each time point about the grouping; b. Calculate the correlation matrix of these sequences; c. Get the sequence of the correlation matrix about time, find this The mean of the sequence; d. Use this mean matrix to pick out the most relevant factor groups; e. For each factor group, choose the one with the best effectiveness or the best return as the final factor. ; The main methods of dimensionality reduction are: factor simple average dimensionality reduction method, factor historical average return weighted average dimensionality reduction method, stepwise regression, principal component analysis, etc.; there are many methods for factor weighting, three types are briefly introduced here: Equal weight assignment, regression assignment, IC-IR factor assignment. ; We can screen out the stocks with more prominent factors, and realize the excess return of the factors through these stocks. There are two common stock selection methods, namely the scoring method and the regression method. The regression method is to use the past stock returns to return to the multi-factor model to get the regression equation, and then substitute the latest factor value into the regression equation to get a worthy prediction for the future stocks, and screen the stocks based on this prediction. ; Transferable alpha=alpha+other beta;

- 20200413: Use Occam's razor for factor analysis:

Using too many factors may lead to overfitting. When conducting factor analysis, we believe that investors should regard "degree of freedom" as an important determinant of the degree of confidence in the analysis results. We define the degree of freedom as the number of revenue data points minus the number of explanatory factors. We believe that the greater the degree of freedom, the more confident we are in the estimated factor relationships. A common rule of thumb for statisticians is that earnings data should be 10 times the number of factors. There are statistical methods that can help determine which factors are really important. For example, Akaike information criterion is a method that can be used for variable selection. It is achieved by weighing the balance between the quality and simplicity of various models, which is basically similar to Occam's razor.

- 20190730 AQR machine learning application

Risks in financial markets are highly predictable, that is, risk predictions benefit from a relatively high signal-to-noise ratio. Related to this, the transaction costs incurred by price effects are predictable and have a fairly high degree of accuracy. Unlike earnings prediction, there is no obvious trend in investor behavior to eliminate this predictability, making machine learning more suitable for modeling risk and transaction costs.
